# to-determine-the-gender-of-a-person

General information
It is proposed to work with bank data and solve the problem: to determine the gender of the client by his financial expenses.

The main data consists of the history of bank transactions and demographic information for a certain sample of customers (the data is depersonalized and distorted in a special way).

For clients whose gender is unknown (which are not in the training sample customers_gender_train.csv, but which are in transactions.csv), it is necessary to predict the probability of being male (value 1).
